We know that route handlers/middleware in Express need to take in a function and that function gets called with the (req, res, next) arguments and we want to make it async, so we can do:

app.get('/myroute', async (req, res, next) => {
    ...
})

So that works and I can do this for every route. However, now I'll have to handle each error inside of the async function using try/catch everywhere and I'll have to do that for every route. How can I clean this up? Well since async functions return Promises, I know I can add a .catch() block to it, but I need to be able to pass next to the catch block. The only way to do that is with closures:

const myFunc = async (req, res, next) => {
    ...
})
 
app.get('/myroute', (req, res, next) => {
    myFunc(req, res, next).catch(next)
})

Now when an error occurs, our .catch() block will catch it and call next() with the error. The next problem is that I need to generalize this so I can pass in any function I want so we wrap it in yet another function:

const catchAsync = fn => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        fn(req, res, next).catch(next)
    }
}
